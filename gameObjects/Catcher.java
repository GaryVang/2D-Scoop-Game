 * This class is the base class for all catcher type objects.
 * Currently, there is only one type of catcher object, net.
 * Due to there not being any other catcher object, this class is essentially
 * empty and serves as the parent class that implements the interface, IGuided.
 * 
 * If there ends up being another Catcher object aside from net, their
 * common fields and methods would then be placed below.
